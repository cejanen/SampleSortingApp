# SampleSortingApp
Imagine simple mobile app with list of messages. Every message has user and date when it was sent. Date is represented as unix timestamp. Your client come with urgent request to show messages on screen sorted by dates. Unfortunatelly messages comes from API endpoint unsorted and backend team is still drunk after teambuilding to make changes on API. You have to do it yourself without using sort or any high-order swift functions.
